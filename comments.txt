Tyler's Comments

2016.09.26 - Great work Maxime, so far (alphabetically in repo names) you are
the only person to understand question 2 of HW2 (although I'm not so sure that
means you did well or I did poorly...). Your work is very good, although more
comments would be nice. Additionally, you made different files for different
questions (I guess?), but should try to keep things clean and concise.
Your paricipation in class is great and you seem to catch on quickly, so don't
be afraid to help your classmates! Thanks for participating and see you Friday.

2016.10.03 - HW4 - Nice job Maxime, yours was one of only a handful of complete
solutions. I might point out though that return(print()) is a bit redundant.
Other than that, really nice work.

2016.10.25 - HW5 - Great job Maxime. Just a thought (not a criticism,
             just in case you didn't think about it) you should start
             trying to avoid using loops, despite all the loops we
             used the first half of the semester. For example you can create
             a random vector of ones and zeros using sample and then convert
             it to heads and tails. A good thing to practice in the future!

2016.11.05 - HW7 and HW8 - Interesting choice of airplane crash data (this
             was too scary for me). I won't be going to Brazil any time soon,
             but you might look again at Korea. During the 90s Korean flights
             were almost barred from entering the US because they crashed so
             often and it was driven by a bizarre thing in their language.
             A pretty interesting example of something that wouldn't show up
             in the data!
