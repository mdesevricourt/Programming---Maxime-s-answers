Tyler's Comments

2016.09.26 - Great work Maxime, so far (alphabetically in repo names) you are
the only person to understand question 2 of HW2 (although I'm not so sure that
means you did well or I did poorly...). Your work is very good, although more
comments would be nice. Additionally, you made different files for different
questions (I guess?), but should try to keep things clean and concise.
Your paricipation in class is great and you seem to catch on quickly, so don't
be afraid to help your classmates! Thanks for participating and see you Friday.

2016.10.03 - HW4 - Nice job Maxime, yours was one of only a handful of complete
solutions. I might point out though that return(print()) is a bit redundant.
Other than that, really nice work.
